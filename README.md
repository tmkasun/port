What is Smart VTS
----------------------------
This vehicletracking system will enable the owner or a third party to track the vehicle's location, 
using GPS andGSM technology, which would be the accurate way of tracking vehicle. 
The GPSdevice will continuously give the data i.e. the latitude and longitude indicating the position of the vehicle and with some more details. 
The same data is sent to the serverat the other end from where the position of the vehicle is demanded. Those data will map on a web application and will give the path of the vehicle in real time. 


Further this application is capable of keeping records of history, showing driver details andhandles number of prime movers at once.A GPS modulewith GSM/GPRS module is attached to the prime mover. The GPS module is capableof getting the current location coordinates of the vehicle and the GSM / GPRSmodule will upload those coordinates to a server. The system will retrieve those coordinates and map the movements of the prime movers on to a digital map.
